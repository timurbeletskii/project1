  <h1> My Academics </h1>
  <p> Some of my favorites classes at Cornell so far have been MATH 1920,
    CS 2110, and CS 2800.
  </p>

  <h2> MATH 1920: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers </h2>

  <p> I took 1920 in Fall 2020, online with Professor Steven Strogatz. He was a
  great professor, I really enjoyed the semester with him- he was very caring
  to his students, and you could tell he was brillant. While 1920 was a very
  application based class (typical engineering class), Professor Strogatz always
  went into detail about the intuition behind the math while also discussing
  real life applications.</p>

  <h2> CS 2800: Discrete Structures </h2>

  <p> I took 2800 in Spring 2020, hybrid with Professor Michael George. This was
  my first introduction to proof based math and I found it extremely rewarding
  (and also extremely challenging!) The course material was very foreign to me-
  in high school I only learned basic math like algebra, trignomitery
  and first year calculus so set theory and proofs were a big culture shock math
  wise. The class took a lot of work, but it definitely improved my matematical
  maturity by a lot. I'm excited to take the follow up course, CS 4820, Introduction
  to Algorithms!</p>

  <h2> CS 2110: Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures </h2>

  <p> I took 2110 in Spring 2020, hybrid with Professors David Gries and Michael
  Clarkson. This class is core in the CS major, and an introduction to object
  oriented programming and data structures. I already had a decent understanding
  of the object oriented programming concepts thru AP Computer Science, but the
  data structures were all new to me. This class was a lot of fun! The material
  is essential for software engineering interviews and work. I enjoyed it a lot,
  so I am working as a consultant for the class in the Spring.</p>

  <p> A big part of MATH 1920 was learning how to graph quadric surfaces and integrate
    over them! I used a website called CalcPlot3D to graph these surfaces, which was
    extremely helpful to help memorize and understand the 3D equations. Source: CalcPlot3D </p>
